- 👋 Hi, I’m @drAbreu, a Spanish nerdy metalhead that went from studying the cosmos to help improving the research of cosmos' ultimate wonder: life.

- 👀 From telescopes to microscopes. I am an Astrophysicist that will join, as a machine learning developer, [EMBO: SourceData](https://sourcedata.embo.org/) on April 2022.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning and improving my skills with NLP, Pytorch, and HuggingFace.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the exciting projects at EMBO, intended to improve the research experience and the way scientists share data about their findings.

- 📫 Reach me at j-vicente@web.de
